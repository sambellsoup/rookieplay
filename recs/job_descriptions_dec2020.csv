For each component, the failure modes and their resulting effects on the rest of the system are recorded in a specific FMEA worksheet. Worksheets are compiled until all failure modes and their causes and effects are identified. FMEAs will be performed initially at a functional level and as the design matures at a detail design (piece part) level. Functional analyses are used as an input to determine correct failure modes, at all system levels, both for functional FMEA or piece part FMEA. Development of Criticality Analysis which is used to chart the probability of failure modes against the severity of their consequences. The results of this analysis identifies failure modes with relatively high probability and severity of consequences, allowing remedial effort to be directed where it will produce the greatest value. The FMEA/FMECA is a design tool used to systematically analyze postulated component failures and identify the resultant effects on system operations. Development of an FMEA requires that the analyst include all significant failure modes for each contributing element or part in the system. • Develop Reliability Analysis which involves construction of a model (life distribution) that represents the time to failure of the entire system based on the life distributions of the components, sub-assemblies and/or assemblies (black boxes) from which it is composed. In the conduct of this analysis the relationships between components are considered and decisions about the choice of components can be made to improve or optimize the overall product reliability.

4,QA Tester,Computer & IT,"Quality Assurance Testers (“QA Testers”) perform a vital role in game development: testing, analyzing, and recording, any flaws or “bugs.” These refinements ultimately lead to higher quality and better playability of the finished game. The job involves: testing the game in a systematic way, analyzing the game's performance against the designer's intentions, identifying and reporting problems, and suggesting improvements. However, it also involves creativity and ingenuity, which is used to figure how to ‘break’ the game in different and unique ways. In effect, QA Testers act as the game's first audience by reporting on playability and identifying any aspects that could be improved. Testers are responsible for finding these bugs in a game before it goes public and assuring quality in the final product. 

QA Testers must know how categorize bugs and be able to prioritize their time and workload. They work to deadlines and must have an understanding of production and marketing schedules. They use a software quality management system to document their findings into a centralized database which is then shared with other EA QA groups located worldwide. Testers typically work in teams-- which makes communication and teamwork a necessity. 

Testing involves playing the same game repeatedly for weeks at a time, testing different levels and versions or revisions of the game. Sometimes, different teams are responsible for specific sections or areas of a game. The work can be repetitive and tedious; however, QA Testers must be able to stay motivated and test the game long after the novelty and fun factor may have worn off. They must be diplomatic and professional when communicating with other team members; they must accept that they can have only limited influence over the design. They must also be able to anticipate different ways the game will be played by people around the world, and test accordingly.
